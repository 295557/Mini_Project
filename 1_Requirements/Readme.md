## Introduction
 * A calculator is a computing machine whose purpose is to do mathematical computations under direct human guidance. The simplest calculators perform the basic mathematical functions addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
 * calculator is used to perform equations quickly and a calculator is used for an instant and on the spot result which has made human life very dependent on calculators
## Research
### BASIC FUNCTIONS
Addition
 The addition (sum function) is used by clicking on the "+" button or using the keyboard. Thefunction results in a+b.
Subtraction
 The subtraction (minus function) is used by clicking on the "-" button or using the keyboard.The function results in a-b.
Multiplication
 The multiplication (times function) is used by clicking on the "x" button or using the keyboard"*" key. The function results in a*b.
Division
 The division (divide function) is used by clicking on the "/" button or using the keyboard "/"key. The function results in a/b.
Square
 The square function is used by clicking on the "x^2" button or type "^2". The function results inx*x.
Square Root
 The square root function is used by clicking on the "x" button or type "sqrt()". Thisfunction represents x^.5 where the result squared is equal to x.
Raise to the Power
The raise to the power (y raised to the x function) is used by clicking on the "y^x" button ortype "^".
Factorial
 The Factorial function is used by clicking the "!" button or type "!".

### Benefits
 * This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. 
 * It can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem.
 * They are saved from monotonous calculations and the same boring mundane procedure.
 * As a professional, in any field, the Calculator save time, energy and increases efficiency in workplace.

## Cost and Features
Time | Feature | Cost | 
1820 | ARITHMOMETER:First Commercially Produced Mechanical Calculator The production debut of the Arithmometer in 1851 launched the mechanical calculator industry. |300 francs 
1954 | First All-Transistor Calculator |The IBM 608 was the first calculating machine to use solid-state transistors instead of vacuum tubes. The machine was housed in several large cabinets. |$83, 210 |
1961 | ANITA MK-8:the vacuum tubeâ€“based calculator was released in 1961 under the name ANITA MK-8. The machine featured approximately 170 cold cathode vacuum tubes, a Dekatron decade counter tube and Numicator display/indicator tubes.| $1000 |

## Defining Our System
### Explanation:
The project will be a simple Calculator implementation in C. You will use various calculations to calculate different mathematical operations. 
Your calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators, so start by creating functions for the following items
1.add
2.subtract
3.multiply
4.divide
5.modulus
6.square
7.cube
8.square root
Once the opearands are entered and operator is selected from the list that particular opeartion is performed based on the option selected.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT Analysis](https://github.com/295557/Mini_Project/blob/main/1_Requirements/SWOT.png)

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
* Users who need to calculate the opeartions or the basic functions like  students,professionals ,and it is used in shops,restaurants,hotels etc.

## What:
* it does operations of the basic functions based on the options that is it given by the user like additon,subtraction,multiplication etc. based on it the particular function is executed the displayed.

## When:
* when they need to compute the results like for students to calculate the results of thier scores etc. based on the functions like add,sub,multipy etc.
## Where:
* it is used in shops,colleges,schools etc.
## How:
* its used based on the option thata user selects based on the list given like additon,subtraction,etc. based on the selected opearation operands are asked from the user to enter the numbers and operation that is selected and that particular function is executed and the result is displayed on the screen when enter is pressed.
