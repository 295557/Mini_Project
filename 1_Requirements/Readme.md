## Introduction
 * A calculator is a computing machine whose purpose is to do mathematical computations under direct human guidance. The simplest calculators perform the basic mathematical functions addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.
 * calculator is used to perform equations quickly and a calculator is used for an instant and on the spot result which has made human life very dependent on calculators
## Research
### BASIC FUNCTIONS
Addition
 The addition (sum function) is used by clicking on the "+" button or using the keyboard. Thefunction results in a+b.
Subtraction
 The subtraction (minus function) is used by clicking on the "-" button or using the keyboard.The function results in a-b.
Multiplication
 The multiplication (times function) is used by clicking on the "x" button or using the keyboard"*" key. The function results in a*b.
Division
 The division (divide function) is used by clicking on the "/" button or using the keyboard "/"key. The function results in a/b.
Square
 The square function is used by clicking on the "x^2" button or type "^2". The function results inx*x.
Square Root
 The square root function is used by clicking on the "x" button or type "sqrt()". Thisfunction represents x^.5 where the result squared is equal to x.
Raise to the Power
The raise to the power (y raised to the x function) is used by clicking on the "y^x" button ortype "^".
Factorial
 The Factorial function is used by clicking the "!" button or type "!".

### Benefits
*This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. 
*It can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem.
*They are saved from monotonous calculations and the same boring mundane procedure.
*As a professional, in any field, the Calculator save time, energy and increases efficiency in workplace.

### Certain assumptions:


### Explanation:


## SWOT ANALYSIS


# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
* Small and medium size clinics Providing Covid vaccinations to patients

## What:
* Many Clinics are not able to afford high end HMS or ERP systems and hence still depend on manual filing systems. During COVID vaccinations it becomes a tedious task to manage every patient with hand written file system

## When:
* This problem began in February 2021, when COVID Vaccination Drive began and small/medium clinics will soon have to administer vaccinations to people.

## Where:
* This problem is expected to surface in all states of India.

## How:
* This problem may cause ineffective vaccine management and hence there can be a huge amount of vaccine wastage. As per recent data in cities like Noida and Delhi till date 9%-18% vaccines have gone to waste.
